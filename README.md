 <p align="center"> </p>
</p>

For `A Coarse-to-fine Cascaded Evidence-Distillation Neural Network for Explainable Fake News Detection` accepted by COLING 2022. `CofCED` is an explainable method proposed by this paper. We present the first study on explainable fake news detection directly utilizing the wisdom of crowds (raw reports), alleviating the dependency on fact-checked reports. 

### Datasets 
We constructed two realistic datasets, i.e., RAWFC and LIAR-RAW, consisting of raw reports for each claim.
- [RAWFC](https://github.com/Nicozwy/CofCED/tree/main/Datasets/RAWFC)
- [LIAR-RAW](https://github.com/Nicozwy/CofCED/tree/main/Datasets/LIAR-RAW)
